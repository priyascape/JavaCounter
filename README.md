# JavaCounter

Keep track of how many times the same visitor visits a certain page. 
To do this, first write a basic counter. 
Create two pages, one that will show you how many times someone has visited the other.

## Topics:
● Session

## Tasks:
● Create and display a counter on http://your_server/counter

● Increment the counter on each visit to http://your_server/

● Counter must start at zero

● No errors regardless of which page is visited first

## Optional Challenges:
● Create a third page that will increment the counter by 2

● Create a reset button to set the counter back to zero
